![I am a Jr.front-end developer and freelancer](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I'm a junior developer in  process. In 2019 I left my career in systems analyst to move to Brazil. In this 2021 I have resumed my studies privately, which has concluded in a wide practical knowledge of different tools and technologies focused on the front-end. However, I can see that this path is just beginning and I am also expanding my horizons towards the Back-end and android development.
