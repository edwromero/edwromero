### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Edwin natanael romero
![BANNER](https://github.com/edwromero/edwromero/blob/main/front-end%20developer.png?raw=true)

I'm a junior developer in  process. In 2019 I left my career in systems analyst to move to Brazil. In this 2021 I have resumed my studies privately, which has concluded in a wide practical knowledge of different tools and technologies focused on the front-end. However, I can see that this path is just beginning and I am also expanding my horizons towards the Back-end and android development.
